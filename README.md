# simple-chatroom
A client-server architecture for a simplistic chatroom design. 

## Getting Started

To get the chatroom running, download both the server and client to a local or different machines. Ensure that the SERVERIP on the client is directed to the correct server. 

### Prerequisites

This server and client operate off of port 12000. If this port is blocked, the chatroom will not operate. Edit this as needed. 
If operating off of a network, make sure both the client machine and server machine are connected to this network (local or LAN)

## Deployment

Start the server before running the client. Any number of clients can connect to the server and all messages will be seen in the chatlog as they communicate.
